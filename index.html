        <h1>MY CODING JOURNEY BEGINS</h1>
        <p>I am beginning my journey in coding, and each tag I acquire seems like to unlocking a new level.This page is
            a little step, but it's the start of something big. <i>Welcome to my journey.</i></p>
        <p>
            I created this page as part of a class assignment, but to me, it’s more than homework-it’s proof that I'm
            growing. <b>I hope one day I'll look back at this and smile, remembering where it all started.</b>

                My name is <b>Michael Ayomide Ogunleke</b>, and I'm currently learning the basics of web development.
                This
                project is part
                of my HTML training, where I’m learning how to build accessible and well-structured web pages using only
                HTML5. I created this page to practice using semantic tags, improve content organization, and follow
                beginner SEO and accessibility best practices. I also dive into CSS, where I learned how to use CSS to
                style Web content as a beginner, which I showcase here.
            </p>
            <p id="p2" class="even">
                I'm just starting my web dev journey. I'm learning how a page's structure changes how it looks. It also
                helps people and search engines understand it better. This site has clear parts: header, navigation,
                main content, and footer. I built it without CSS or JavaScript. Every part has a purpose. I learned to
                make pages clean, simple, and easy to use. Power Learn Project (PLP) helped me a lot. They gave me hope
                to become a great developer. <b>I will always be grateful, PLP!</b>
            </p>
            <p id="p3" class="odd">
                <i>I look forward to learning more as I continue growing in this field. Currently, this page holds both basic HTML and CSS for a beginner,
                    but also an important step in my journey to becoming a web developer.</i>
